### What Is Diabetes?
At its core, diabetes occurs when blood glucose levels are consistently too high. This happens due to:
-  Insufficient insulin production: The pancreas does not produce enough insulin.
-  Ineffective insulin use: The body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.
-  No insulin production: In some cases, the pancreas fails to produce insulin entirely.
Left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to severe complications, including:
-  Eye damage (diabetic retinopathy)
-  Kidney issues (nephropathy Nerve damage (neuropathy)
-  Cardiovascular diseases
